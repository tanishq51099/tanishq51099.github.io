The title of the Project is Multi-Objective Optimization Modeling. For this project I collaborated with Siemens on an engineering design optimization project aimed at developing rule sets (mathematical expressions and ML models) to describe Pareto and rank-based solutions in multi-objective optimization. I worked on evaluating methodologies for predicting Pareto designs and generated a comprehensive report with recommendations using Non Dominated Sorting method (NSGA 2). We formulated methodologies for predicting Pareto designs using Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Feedforward Neural Networks, among which Random Forests was the best.
