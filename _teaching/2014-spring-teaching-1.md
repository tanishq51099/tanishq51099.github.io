•	Collaborate with NASA and WRI on a high-impact initiative to map trees by using remote sensing, contributing to 2030 net-zero carbon emissions goal by implementing U-Net CNN architecture for tree crown segmentation from high-resolution satellite imagery.

•	Achieved publication in IOP Science for groundbreaking research on measuring trees outside forests as nature-based solution for net-zero emissions in South Asia, utilizing remote sensing and advanced machine learning techniques.

•	Enhanced geospatial analysis precision and carbon evaluation accuracy by 14% by integrating K-Means clustering with advanced computer vision techniques, including edge detection and contour plotting algorithms.

•	Developed automated data pipelines for or preprocessing satellite imagery, reducing manual effort by 40% and accelerating tree mapping.

•	Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize geospatial data, enabling intuitive exploration of tree cover area output distribution and carbon sequestration potential.
