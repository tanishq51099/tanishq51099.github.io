title: "Multi-Objective Optimization Modeling (Siemens Capstone Project)"
excerpt: "The title of the Project is Multi-Objective Optimization Modeling. For this project I collaborated with Siemens on an engineering design optimization project aimed at developing rule sets (mathematical expressions and ML models) to describe Pareto and rank-based solutions in multi-objective optimization. I worked on evaluating methodologies for predicting Pareto designs and generated a comprehensive report with recommendations using Non Dominated Sorting method (NSGA 2). We formulated methodologies for predicting Pareto designs using Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Feedforward Neural Networks, among which Random Forests was the best.<br/>"

The Generative Question Answering project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enhance the accuracy and relevance of automated responses. 
By integrating retrieval-based models with generative techniques, the system effectively combines information retrieval with natural language generation. 
The project utilizes models such as T5 and Llama2, fine-tuning them to improve performance in generating contextually appropriate answers.​

A key component of this project is the implementation of Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) techniques. 
Three distinct methods are employed to optimize the retriever model, each focusing on curating and preserving context passages to facilitate efficient information retrieval. 
This approach ensures that the generative model has access to pertinent information, thereby enhancing the quality of the generated responses.​

For a comprehensive overview of the project's results, detailed findings are available in the provided documentation.
