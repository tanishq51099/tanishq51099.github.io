The Generative Question Answering project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enhance the accuracy and relevance of automated responses. 
By integrating retrieval-based models with generative techniques, the system effectively combines information retrieval with natural language generation. 
The project utilizes models such as T5 and Llama2, fine-tuning them to improve performance in generating contextually appropriate answers.​

A key component of this project is the implementation of Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) techniques. 
Three distinct methods are employed to optimize the retriever model, each focusing on curating and preserving context passages to facilitate efficient information retrieval. 
This approach ensures that the generative model has access to pertinent information, thereby enhancing the quality of the generated responses.​

For a comprehensive overview of the project's results, detailed findings are available in the provided documentation.
