title: "Dialogue Summarization"
excerpt: 'In this project, I tackled the Dialogue Summarization task using Generative AI with a focus on improving output quality through prompt engineering. I explored how different input formats and prompt strategies—zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning—impact the summarization performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning prompts and guiding the model behavior, I significantly enhanced the relevance and coherence of the generated summaries. The project utilized the "knkarthick/dialogsum" dataset from Hugging Face, which includes over 13,000 annotated dialogues with human-written summaries and topics. This work not only deepened my understanding of LLMs in NLP tasks but also showcased the power of thoughtful prompt design in tailoring generative outputs for downstream applications. <a href="https://github.com/tanishq51099/Dialogue-Summarization.git">Repo Link</a>'
