Hi, I’m Tanishq Tanmay — a passionate and results-driven Data Scientist with a strong foundation in machine learning, generative AI, geospatial intelligence, and cloud-based solutions. I recently completed my Master’s in Data Science from Michigan State University and have worked on high-impact research projects in collaboration with NASA and the World Resources Institute.

With a deep technical background and hands-on experience across Python, PyTorch, AWS, and advanced modeling frameworks, I specialize in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems — from optimizing multi-objective engineering designs for Siemens to mapping trees outside forests using satellite imagery for global carbon accounting.

I’ve published in top-tier journals, developed industry-grade dashboards, and designed end-to-end AI pipelines, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and tree crown segmentation using deep learning. My work bridges scientific rigor with scalable implementation — whether it's a U-Net on remote sensing data.

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can bring together my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset to drive innovation in data science, sustainability, or AI product development. Let’s build something impactful!
